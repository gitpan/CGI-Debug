   New email address of autor



DESCRIPTION

It's goal is to catch ALL errors and display them, along with useful
data like form data, cookies, etc. You should never see the "Internal
Server Error" message.

The module will not change the behaviour of your cgi program.  As long
as your program works, you will not notice the modules presence. The
only ting you will have to do is "use CGI::Debug". Then your program
works, you can just remove the line.

It's highly configurable. Choose what functions to use.

 Report
 o  warnings
 o  runtime errors
 o  compilation errors
 o  faulty HTTP headers
 o  Form data
 o  Cookies
 o  Enviroment
 o  Elapsed time in subseconds

 Report
 o  to Browser
 o  to error log
 o  to file
 o  as mail to owner and/or others

 Report
 o  if warnings occured
 o  if program died
 o  always


Configure with cookies, or enviroment variables, or on the use
line.


EXAMPLES

Only report errors:
    use CGI::Debug( report => 'errors' );

Do not bother about warnings:
    use CGI::Debug( on => 'fatals' );

Allways show complete debugging info:
    use CGI::Debug( report => 'everything', on => 'anything' );

Send debug data as mail to file owner:
    use CGI::Debug( to => 'mail' );


REQUIRES

 o  CGI
 o  perl 5.004_05


TODO

 o Clean up and generalize configuration

 o Test it on non *nix platforms

 o Implement HTML_compliance controls (using HTML::validate)

 o Implement function for debugging in a separate window
